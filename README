RobotAPI is a modular API for both the e-puck robot and the LDVbot, which is a
somehow similar, but stripped down and much cheaper clone of the e-puck created
at the Chair for Data Processing at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

It replaces the old epucklib and non-public code from our chair used to talk
to the LDVbot. As all our e-pucks do have an overo extension module, the e-puck
related code uses a local serial connection to talk directly to the robot. If
you are used to connect via bluetooth and want to use this library, expect some
effort to make it work.

Some example code how to use this library can be found in the example.py file
in the top level of this repository. Additional documentation about the design
goals and the supplied interfaces can be found in the doc folder (at the moment
only in German).
